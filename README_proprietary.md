# Fibonacci Generator

This Python project contains a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

## Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The sequence begins as follows:
```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
```

## Description

The `fibonacci_generator` function generates the Fibonacci sequence for a specified number of terms. It starts with the numbers 0 and 1, then prints each number in the sequence until the `n`th term is reached.

### Function: `fibonacci_generator(n)`

**Arguments:**
- `n`: The number of Fibonacci terms to generate.

**Returns:**
- The function prints the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.

## Example Usage

```python
# Example: Generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
fibonacci_generator(10)
```

**Output:**
```
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```
